#gae-employee-crud

A really simple implementation of Google Appengine with Python to showcase of CRUD in Google NoSQL-like datastore.

[Google Appengine] (http://cloud.google.com/AppEngine) is a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Services) by Google. 

What this project trying to achieve is trying to showcase how to use create a very simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with Google Appengine in Python and NoSQL Datastore.

To try it out just go to [employee-crud.appspot.com] (http://employee-crud.appspot.com/) and login with your Google account (whether it is @gmail.com or your custom domain under Google Apps for Business).

Feel free to Create, Update and Delete any Employee record as you like it.

I tried to keep the code very simple as this is not for practical use, it is to serve a reference for anyone who is new to Google Appengine and you wonder how to build a simple database application with it. 

The tricky part is NoSQL vs SQL, the differences is rather significant.
